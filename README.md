The key objective of regression-based tasks is to predict output labels or responses which are continues numeric values, for the given input data. The output will be based on what the model has learned in training phase. Basically, regression models use the input data features (independent variables) and their corresponding continuous numeric output values (dependent or outcome variables) to learn specific association between inputs and corresponding outputs.

Types of Regression Models
Regression models are of following two types −

Simple regression model − This is the most basic regression model in which predictions are formed from a single, univariate feature of the data.

Multiple regression model − As name implies, in this regression model the predictions are formed from multiple features of the data.
